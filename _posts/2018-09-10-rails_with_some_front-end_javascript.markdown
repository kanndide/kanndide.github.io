I really don't want to write about this project. This has by far been the worst project I have done. Not that the project is particularly hard or that JavaScript is particularly tricky, it's just that, for me, this project gave me hell. I would like to start off by saying this, Javascript is not Ruby. It's not even similar to Ruby. In an abstract, all computer languages have certain similarities kind of way, sure, but it **FEELS** completely different. Ruby feels good, and it makes itself easy to understand. JavaScript feels old. Just... old. Like, something that probably shouldn't be used anymore but is anyway so everyone just keeps trying to make it better over and over and instead of being better, or different, it just gets weird. Now, I am not a guru and maybe over time it will make more sense to me, but on the whole it feels awkward to use.
<br>
Now that I am done venting, I would like to say that JavaScript isn't what held me up on this project. It was just the simple fact that stuff that worked in labs and worked in other places simply didn't work for me on this project. I updated gems, bundled, insert standard troubleshooting algorithm here, and I still had issues. I had things work perfectly fine then just magically quit working the next day. Sometimes things would only work if I refreshed the page. Sometimes that would stop something from working. There was almost no rhyme or rhythm to it. Much like free-verse and just as aggrivating. With that being said, I did not even attempt to go above and beyond on this one. I honestly believe that had I had this idea in my head before I wrote the Rails project, I wouldn't have any issues. Trying to gobackwards and change everything that I had already written in rails to JavaScript was a huge undertaking that I would have been willing to push through if I didn't run into so many unexplainable issues. Instead I settled with just a little of the project minimums and washed my hands of it.

**Addendum**
*It turns out all the issues that I was having were related to turbolinks (most likely) and once that was taken care everything seemed to work correctly. I still don't have the hang of JavaScript like I felt like I had with Ruby but I intend to get better.*
<br>
I added in what JavaScript functionality that I could without converting the entire front end into JavaScipt in hopes that what I did do would show profiecency or at least a basic understanding of what they wanted. I can see exactly why I would have wanted to use JavaScript from the start. It would have made interactions with my back-end a lot more dynamic and allowed for a little more creativity and functionality on the user's end. I definitely see why it is preferred for the user-end. 
<br> 
This was a very exhausting project and I don't really have much else to say about it. I'm not defeated, but it has shown me that I don't do well when nothing seems to work as it should. All in all I would say that it was a great learning experience. I will never attempt to create a fully functioning app and then try and go back and completely restructure it for a different language. It would honestly have been faster and probably less problematic to completely rewrite it from scratch, or so it felt like.
