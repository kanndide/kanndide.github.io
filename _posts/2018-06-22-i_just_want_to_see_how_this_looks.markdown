I don't think this thing believes in proper indentions.
<br>
I don't even know if it believes in html or mark-up.
<br> 
There really should be more written about using this damn thing.
<br>
Or maybe just let me make do it all on my own, that way I know exactly what I need to do.
Or not.
Perhaps I am just stupid.
